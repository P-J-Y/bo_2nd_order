Benchmark PDRK with fluid dispersion relation solver PDRF at cold plasma limit.
They agree well for the five branches cold waves. theta=60.

Slight differences comes when:
1. The ion cyclotron branch has large damping rate and thus real frequency is also different to fluid one at large k.
2. The sound wave branch, which is probably due to the difference between the cs in fluid and kinetic models. However, if pressure = 0, this branch should not exist.

To do:
1. Check the cS branch;
2. Compare the polarizations;
3. Update pdrf solver.
