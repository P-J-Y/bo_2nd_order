# BO
Plasma waves and instabilities analysis tool, with both kinetic and multi-fluid dispersion relations.

This is a combination of previous several versions of PDRF/PDRK/BO, and with new features.

Major updates:

20-11-14 09:26
Fixed some tiny known bugs found during 191130-200502 by Xie & Denton.

20-11-15 06:00: 
(1) Modify the EM3D matrix em3d_matrix.m to calculate the density and
velocity perturbations/polarizations of each species.

(2) Write a sub-code in kernel.m to calculate the 3-by-3 tensors 
explicitly, say D(omega,k), K, Q, sigama and Q_s, sigma_s.

2020-12-22 21:16
Add the fluid version PDRF/BO-F as an option (iem=3), which uses the same
input and output as the kinetic versions (iem=0,1,2).
Benchmark cold beam between iem=1&3, both frequency and polarizations
agree each other well.

21-04-24 06:29 add bo_cal_df.m to calculate delta f(k,w,vx,vy,vz) for 
electromagnetic 3D case (iem=1), using Eq.(54) of Xie2019CPC paper.
